# Set up the documentation

The documentation source files are in `GenesisCore/documentation` folder.

Here is the layout of the documentation project:

    mkdocs.yml      # The configuration file, e.g., for organizing the pages
    docs/
        index.md    # The documentation homepage
        ...         # Other markdown pages
        imgs/
            ...     # Images
        css/
            extra.css   # style file to customize based on site/theme.css and site/theme_extra.css
    site/           # You can ignore thing here, MkDocs generNates them when you deploy the page


## Step 1: Install MkDocs

[MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#mkdocs) is a Python package for generating static sites, especially good for the documentation style. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

You can install MkDocs using pip or other package manager.

### Install with pip

If you use the Python package manager, [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/), then you can:

```
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install mkdocs
```

To check that it is installed:

```
$ mkdocs --version
mkdocs, version version 1.2.2 from ...
```

### Install with a Package Manager

If you prefer useing another package manager (such as `apt-get`, `dnf`, `homebrew`, `yum`, `chocolatey`, etc.) to install packages on your system, then you may install `MkDocs` with your package manager.


## Step 2: Start MkDocs Server

MkDocs comes with a built-in dev-server that lets you preview your documentation as you work on it. Make sure you're in the same directory as the `mkdocs.yml` configuration file, and then start the server by running the `mkdocs serve` command:

```
$ mkdocs serve
INFO    -  Building documentation...
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
[I 160402 15:50:43 server:271] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[I 160402 15:50:43 handlers:58] Start watching changes ...
```

<!--- mkdocs serve --dev-addr '127.0.0.1:9000' --->

Now you can view the documentation site in [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/), being updated in real time as you save your edits to the files.

## Step 3: Edit Pages

Before you make changes to the documentation, make sure to `git pull` the latest changes made by others to avoid conflict.

### Add a page

If you want to add a page to the wiki, reate a new markdown file in the `docs/` directory.

Then, add its name and markdown file name to `mkdocs.yml`, where you will see:

```
nav:
    - Genesis:
      - Genesis System: index.md
      - Contribute to Documentation: mkdocs.md
    - Representation:
      - Inner Language - Innerese: innerese.md
      - ...
    - Fundamentals:
      - Inference by Rules: inference.md
      - ...
    -
```

The current hierarchy and order is designed so that a new student can use the documentation as a tutorial. Major reorganization is possible upon discussion with [Yang](ztyang@mit.edu):


### Write in Markdown

Our wiki pages are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example), a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. The following cheatsheet designed by Theme Spectre showed the most frequently used syntax:

To make it even easier to write in Markdown, you can add Markdown plugin to your editor. For example, I use `markdown-editor` in Atom to enjoy the following features:

* Toggle text styles using shortcut such as `Ctrl+B`
* Continue lists and table rows when press `enter`
* Correct ordered list numbers


## Step 4: Deploy After Editing

NOTE: At this moment, only Yang should deploy the changes to the website to avoid git merge problems. Please let her know of the changes you made.

### Routine deploy with one command

Currently, the wiki page is hosted publicly on GitHub. We may later shift over to private domains.

After you have made the changes, simply do this in the same directory as the `mkdocs.yml` file:

```
mkdocs gh-deploy --clean
```

The page will be updated on [https://ztyang-mit.github.io/tom-minecraft/](https://zt-yang.github.io/tom-minecraft/).

Note that if you only made changes within the documentation folder, you don't have to `git push`. The deploy command does it for you.


## Summary

In this article, you have learned how to install the MkDocs package, write documentation pages, and deloy the site.

* Every time you make changes to the documentation, you need to use the following two commands at the project directory.

```
$ git pull
$ mkdocs serve              # before editting, start the MkDocs server
```

* During editing, you add and organize pages at the configuration page, `mkdocs.yml`.
* After editing, you should let Yang know of the changes you made and `git push`
